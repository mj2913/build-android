##The aim of this project was to create a chat application that could be used to support community development, cooperative learning, and teacher involvement in student learning and conversation facilitation. In doing so, I wanted to challenge myself to engage application development, while also getting accustomed to utilizing firebase.

##This application does that. With an intuitive interface, I used Java and Firebase to implement a simple program that allows users to send messages. These messages are saved within the application and are also uploaded to Firebase’s RealTime Database. Currently, both users and teachers can read and write for the app. Ultimately, only teachers will have the authorization to do so. This can be updated in Firebase through the RealTime Database application. I also used Google Authorization to allow for sign-in and access to the application—Firebase has a really easy process for implementing this.
